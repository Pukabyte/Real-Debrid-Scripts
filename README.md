Scripts I use to help maintain symlinks with Real-debrid and organise my library.

# Discard
Created by @west
- Removes torrents from Real-Debrid that do not have a symlink attached to them

Change `path/to/debrid/mount` to the parent folder where all your links/symlinks point to

Change `path/to/symlinks` to the parent media (plex) folder where all your symlinks are

# Symclean
- rewrites symlinks if some were made using the old volume mapping method (/mount/torrents) to the new volume mapping method (/mnt/remote/realdebrid)
- read the code and make the neccessary changes as per needed for your use case.
